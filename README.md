## Built With

* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.

## How to play:

* There will be four mascots displayed as buttons on the page.

* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a mascot, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

* Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a mascot.
* When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

* When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the mascots will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
